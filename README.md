Just your friendly neighborhood Software Engineer! When I'm not making websites, I like to spend my free time watching soccer (football ‚öΩÔ∏è) 
from leagues all across Europe with the Premier League being my favorite. As far as code related, I am a self-taught Software Engineer and feel accomplished of
what I have done so far and looking forward to what comes next.
